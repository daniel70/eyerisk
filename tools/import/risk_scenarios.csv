Virus Infection,15 Malware,1502,"External hackers with the motivation to cause business disruption use viruses to attack a company’s IT systems. 
The detection of the event is immediate because the information is lost at the time of the virus infection. For the same reason, 
the time lag between event and consequence is immediate.The enterprise is infected with a virus that has a malicious payload that causes certain types of files to be deleted. In some cases, the virus was designed to delete the entire drive contents. 
Through the attack of the enterprise’s IT infrastructure, information is destroyed, preventing timely business decisions.",The nature of the event is a malicious infection with a virus.,"The actors that generate the threat that exploits the vulnerability are 
external hackers with the motivation to cause business disruption.","The event results in destruction of information and
interruption of business processes.","The asset/resource that leads to the business impact are people, specifically, 
the hackers that attack the systems with the virus.","The assets/resources that are affected by the event are different business processes that are 
interrupted and information that is destroyed.","The duration of the event is extended because the attack of the enterprise’s IT infrastructure destroys information. 
The timing of occurrence is critical because it prevents timely business decisions. The detection of the event is 
immediate because the information is lost at the time of the virus infection. 
For the same reason, the time lag between event and consequence is immediate.  ",N/A,N/A,P,N/A,"The board makes the decision that no one would be interested

Employee termination and theft,15 Malware,1503,"An employee has been notified that, due to company budget restrictions, he is going to be laid off in the next 30 days. 
This person considers himself to be a critical asset to the company, and after he is notified, as revenge, he starts to copy 
enterprise core data and email them to competitors.
After securing these data on his own media device, he designs a time bomb and puts it into production systems to change s
ystems logic that supports critical business functions (90 days after he is gone from the company) that will result in 
great losses to the company.
Because this employee is very close to the company’s chief information security officer (CISO), who 
is going to retire from the company, the CISO agrees to help this employee alter the company’s security controls.",The nature of the event is malicious.,"The actor that generates the threat that exploits a vulnerability is 
internal—the employee who was laid off.","The event is disclosure of company data and 
unauthorized modification of the systems logic 
by the time bomb.","The asset/resource that leads to the business impact is people 
(the employee who was laid off). The ineffective design and ineffective 
execution of the processes DSS05 Manage security services and 
APO07 Manage human resources are also resources.","The resources that are affected are the business processes that are supported by the system 
logic that was changed by the time-bomb and information, such as the core enterprise data 
that were copied and sent to competitors.","The duration of the event is extended because it takes a long time to correct the affected system logic, the damage to reputation and the business due to the disclosed core enterprise data. Timing is critical because the CISO is going to retire. The detection is slow because the time bomb is not detected before it destroys the system logic. For the same reason, the time lag between the event and the consequence is delayed.",N/A,N/A,P,N/A,N/A,N/A,"The enterprise needs to update the human resources (HR) policy for employee termination, especially for critical employees,
defining processes, including notification to the IT department. The IT department, after notification, should: – Verify and actively monitor employee’s activity log after employee is notified.
– Build special reports to management on this activity log.
– Limit data access to critical resources."
Phishing ,15 Malware,1504,"A group of hackers send spam emails to a large number of users in an enterprise, purporting to be from the company, informing them that there has been a security issue with their company user account and requesting that they verify their logon credentials. These credentials will be captured by the malware and used at a later date to gain unauthorized access to company business systems. This information is then sold to a competitor.","The nature of the event is the malicious action by the hackers
and the spam email that is received and accessed by 
employees accidentally, and results in users being tricked into
providing their log-on credentials, and hackers then using 
these credentials to gain access to the enterprise’s business 
systems and information.","The actors that generate the threat that exploits the vulnerability are the external hackers who are distributing the malware in the email. The internal employees are also actors by opening the email and acting on the request, providing their log-on credentials.","The event is theft and disclosure of data because credentials are used to gain access to the enterprise’s business systems and information, and sensitive commercial information is then sold to a competitor.","The asset/resource that lead to the business impact is people because they are the hackers, and also the employees who were tricked.","The asset/resource that is affected is the stolen and sensitive commercial 
information, which is then sold to a competitor. ","When the credentials are used by the hackers to gain unauthorized access to the enterprise’s business systems, it is critical that the event be detected quickly because the company is planning a marketing action and competitors could get to market sooner. However, the duration may be extended because the stolen information can be used by the competitors over a longer period to gain clients from the attacked company. Detection is probably moderate and the time lag between event and consequence is delayed because there may be a delay from the time that the hackers gain log-on credentials, to the time they use them to gain unauthorized access.",N/A,N/A,P,N/A,N/A,"Use a hosted email service, which includes a spam filtering service.","Implement spam filters to identify and quarantine spam emails, and educate end-users. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
to identify logon attempts coming from outside the enterprise."
Network penetration,16 Logical attacks ,1602,"An enterprise has a public web site, through which a group of hackers takes down the enterprise’s business systems. 
This is done by breaching the enterprise’s network perimeter and penetrating the network, and then introducing malware 
that takes down the servers and results in a successful denial-of-service (DOS) attack, which denies users access to 
applications. Normal business operations are disrupted. Sales cannot be processed over the company’s web site, causing 
loss of revenue and reputational damage.","The nature of the event is a malicious DOS attack by 
hackers, which takes down the servers, denying users 
access to applications and information.","The actors that generate the threat that exploits the vulnerability 
are the external hackers.","The event is interruption of IT services so that 
users cannot access the applications and 
information and, therefore, normal business 
processes/ operations are interrupted and sales 
cannot be processed over the company’s web site, 
causing loss of revenue and reputational damage.","
The asset/resource that leads to the business impact are people—the hackers.","The asset/resources that are affected are mainly the interrupted business operations. However, because access is denied to the enterprise’s IT infrastructure, information and applications are also affected.","Response to the DOS attack is critical to restore access to business systems quickly and so sales can be issued again. The duration is extended because it may take quite some time to restore the official web site. Detection of the event is immediate, and the time lag between the event and the consequence is also immediate.",N/A,N/A,P,N/A,"The board makes the decision that no one would be interested in attacking the enterprise, “it won’t happen to us.”",Take out business disruption insurance.,"Install and configure a firewall, server hardening and security patches that are kept up to date.

Industrial espionage,16 Logical attacks ,1604,"A successful worldwide pharmaceutical company is subject to industrial espionage from advanced persistent threats (APTs) 
by external hackers. A foreign government sponsored the hackers to gain research and development secrets to help 
advance the pharmaceutical industry within its country. The IT infrastructure was penetrated by the use of APT techniques, 
and sensitive product research and development information stolen and leaked out, allowing cheaper competing products 
to be brought to market.","The nature of the event is malicious penetration of the IT 
infrastructure by the use of APT techniques.",The actors that generate the threat that exploits the vulnerability are external hackers sponsored by an external foreign government.,"The event is theft and disclosure because the IT infrastructure was penetrated and sensitive product research and development information was stolen, allowing cheaper competing products to be brought to market.",The asset/resource that leads to the business impact are people—the hackers.,The assets/resources that are affected are the penetrated IT infrastructure and the sensitive product research and stolen development information.,"Response to the denial of service (DOS) attack is critical to restore access to business systems quickly and so sales can be issued again. The duration is extended because it may take quite some time to restore the official web site. Detection of the event is immediate and the time lag between the event and the consequence is also immediate.
The duration of the event is extended because APTs usually remain undetected for quite some time. The timing of occurrence is critical because the company has a short period of time before issuing a new pharmaceutical product based on the sensitive research results. Because it may be a long period of time before this information leakage is detected, the classification for the detection is slow, and, for the same reason, the time lag between event and consequence is delayed.",N/A,N/A,P,N/A,"The board makes the decision that no one would be interested in 
attacking the enterprise, “it won’t happen to us.”",N/A,"Install and appropriately configure firewalls, server hardening and ensure that security patches are installed in a timely manner.

Hacktivism ,16 Logical attacks ,1606,"Hacktivism (the combination of hacking and activism) involves inserting or modifying code to promote political ideology—
promoting political expression, freedom of speech, human rights, etc. An activist group hacks into a government’s web site 
and changes the information on a web page to publicize the group’s political messages and cause public embarrassment to 
the government.","The nature of the event is a malicious act by an activist group 
that exploits vulnerabilities in the government’s IT 
infrastructure and posts information on the government’s 
official web site that provides a view that is contrary to 
government policy, or to promote the group’s ideology.",The actor that generates the threat that exploits the vulnerability is an external activist.,The event is an interruption as the government’s infrastructure is attacked and information is modified on the web site.,The asset/resource that lead to the business impact people—the political activists.,The assets/resources that are affected are the government’s IT infrastructure that is attacked and the information changed on the web site.,The duration of the event is likely to be moderate because such changes to web sites are usually noticed shortly after the event and can be corrected by uploading the backup of the web site. The timing of occurrence is critical because visitors to the government web site usually need the provided information immediately. The time taken to detect the change is also moderate because such changes to web sites are usually reported quickly by the visitors of the web site. The time lag between the event and consequence is immediate because the web site is changed at the same time that the hack happens.,N/A,N/A,P,N/A,"The board makes the decision that no one would be interested in 
attacking the enterprise, “it won’t happen to us.”",N/A,"Install and appropriately configure firewalls, server hardening and ensure that security patches are installed in a timely manner.
